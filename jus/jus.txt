Twilight over a vast, rugged mountain range. A supernatural rider—Ghost Rider-inspired—stands still on a hellfire-infused dirt bike. Close-up: his skull burns with eerie orange flames, chains wrapped around his leather jacket glint in the fading light. The wind stirs the dirt around him—tiny particles float up from the trail. Suddenly, as the rider revs the engine, the dirt particles begin to ignite mid-air, transforming into glowing embers and flame fragments, slowly lifting and swirling around him like fireflies drawn to his power. The moment he takes off—those fiery particles trail behind him, forming a blazing wake through the rugged terrain. The dirt bike roars across rocky hills, leaving a streak of scorched earth. Tracking shot from low angle: each jump sends sparks and flaming debris into the air. Cinematic slow motion as flaming dust explodes off the tires. Drone shot: the mountain trail lights up with supernatural fire, a comet-like trail following the Ghost Rider as he vanishes into the smoky horizon. Tone: epic, fiery, mysterious, supernatural, visually stunning
